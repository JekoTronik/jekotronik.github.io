## Bonjour, VeeFriends !

I'm Jérémy, I live in France, near Paris. 

I know a lot of you bought a lot of Gary's books. Well done, big win !

Like you, I want each book to be an amazing story for an amazing person.

But maybe you'll get more books than you know who to give them to.

No worries, I got your back. ;)

If you contact me and tell me how many books you don't know what to do with, I will come to collect them, buy you a coffee, do a selfie together, thank you for being a VeeFriends.

Then I will organize donations for all the books I got !

I will find underrepresented communities like student associations, disabled person at hospital,… Who would benefit from getting the books ! All in public.

If you live in another country, feel free to ask me to add you to the list of donations coordinators. Would be awesome !
